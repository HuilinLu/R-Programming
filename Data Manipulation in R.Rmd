### Filtering Data Using Brackets
```{r eval=TRUE}

demo <- read.csv('demographics.csv')

### how to filter (select) your data data in base R using
brackets
### a new data frame, demo2, will be created each time
######
### one filter variable
######
### select the female subjects

demo2 = demo[demo$gender == 'Female', ]
head(demo2, 3)
## Put a comma which tells the program that we want to retain all the variables of the initial dataframe.

### retain the subjects with the income greater than 100
demo2 <- demo[demo$income > 100,]

### if you want to keep only the variables 1, 3 and 7
### (age, income and gender)
demo2 = demo[demo$income > 100, c(1,3,7)]
demo2 = demo[demo$income > 100, c('age', 'income', 'gender')]

### if you want to drop variables 6, 7 and 8
### (car category, gender and retired)
demo2 = demo[demo$income > 100, -c(6:8)]

######
### two or more filter variables
######
### select the female subjects with the income over 100
demo2 = demo[demo$gender == "Female" & demo$income > 100,]
head(demo2, 3)


```

### Filtering Data with the Subset Command
```{r eval = TRUE}

demo <- read.csv("demographics.csv")
View(demo)
### how to filter (select) your data in base R using subset function
### a new data frame, demo2, will be created each time
### keep the married subjects only (one filter variable)
demo2 = subset(demo, demo$mamarital == 'Married', select = c(1:3))
demo2 <- subset(demo, marital == "Married")
View(demo2)

### retain the married subjects aged over 35
### (two filter variables)
demo2 <- subset(demo, marital == "Married" & age > 35)

### keep the first three variables only
### (age, marital status, income)
demo2 <- subset(demo, marital == "Married" & age > 35, select = c(1:3))

### drop variables 4, 5, 6 and 8
### (education, car price, car category, retired)
demo2 <- subset(demo, marital == "Married" & age > 35, select = -c(4:6, 8))


```


### Filtering Data with dplyr

```{r eval = TRUE}
library(dplyr)

### how to filter (select) your data using the dplyr package
### a new data frame, demo2, will be created each time
### load the package

require(dplyr)
### keep the unmarried subjects only
### (one filter variable)
demo2 <- filter(demo, marital == "Unmarried")

### keep the unmarried subjects only aged under 50
### (two filter variables)
demo2 <- filter(demo, marital == 'Unmarried', age < 50)

### if you want to keep some variables only,
### you must first specify the variables you want to keep
### suppose we want to keep only the first three variables in sequence
### (age, marital status, income)
demo2 <- select(demo, c(1:3))
demo2 <- select(demo, age, marital, income)


### next we filter our new data frame demo2,
### keeping only the unmarried persons aged under 50
demo2 <- filter(demo2, marital == "Unmarried", age < 50)

head(demo2, n=3)
```

### Recoding Categorical Variables

```{r eval = TRUE}

### how to recode the categorical (factor) variables
### we want to convert the variable gender as follows
### Male = 1, Female = 2
### a new variable gender2 will be created
### first we will use the brackets (base R)
demo$gender2[demo$gender == 'Male'] = '1'
demo$gender2[demo$gender == 'Female'] = '2'
head(demo, n=3)


##########
### we can do the same type of recoding with the plyr package, function revalue
### load the package
library(plyr)
### let's create a new variable, gender3
demo$gender3 = revalue(demo$gender, c('Male' = '1', 'Female' = '2'))
head(demo, n=3)

typeof(demo$gender2)


### important: if the variable to recode is not a factor
### we must convert it into a factor before recoding
demo$gender = factor(demo$gender)
### to recode into the same variable (without creating a new one)
### we just use the same variable name in both sides of the revalue function
demo$gender = revalue(demo$gender, c("Male"="1", "Female"="2"))


```


###Recoding Continuous Variables

```{r eval = TRUE}

### how to recode a continous variable into a factor
### we want to create a categorical variable as follows
### subjects with income under 200 - low income
### subjects with income of 200 and more - high income
### a new variable, incat (income category), will be created

demo$incat[demo$income < 200] = 'Low Income'

demo$incat[demo$income >= 200] = 'High Income'
head(demo, 3)

### now we want to create three groups by income
### low income - under 150
### medium income - between 150 and 300
### high income - 300 and more
### so we will have two cut points: 150 and 300
### a new variable, incat2, will be created

## Old Method:
demo$incat2[demo$income <150] = 'Low Income'
demo$incat2[demo$income >=150 & demo$income <= 300] = 'Medium Income'
demo$incat2[demo$income > 300] = 'High Income'
head(demo, 3)

## New Method, use cut function
demo$incat2 = cut(demo$income, breaks = c(-Inf, 150, 300, Inf), labels = c('Low Income', 'Medium Income', 'High Income'))
head(demo, 3)


### by default, the ranges are open on the left, and closed on the right
### namely (-Inf,150], (150, 300] and (300, Inf)
### to get it conversely, use the option right=FALSE
demo$incat2 = cut(demo$income, breaks = c(-Inf, 150, 300, Inf), labels = c('Low Income', 'Medium Income', 'High Income'), right = FALSE)
head(demo, 3)


```


### Sorting Data Frames

```{r eval = TRUE}

### how to sort a data frame
### a new data frame, demo2, will be created each time
### sort by income, ascending (default), use order function

## default ascending order
demo2 = demo[order(demo$income), ]

### sort by income, descending
demo2 = demo[order(-demo$income),]
demo2 = demo[order(demo$income, decreasing = TRUE), ]

### sort by income and age
demo2 = demo[order(demo$income, demo$age), ]

### sort by income (ascending) and age (descending)
demo2 = demo[order(demo$income, -demo$age), ]


```



### Computing New Variables

```{r eval = TRUE}

math <- read.csv("math.csv")
View(math)

### how to compute a new variable
### we will create a variable that stores the difference between the two grades

math$diff = math$grade2 - math$grade1

### another variable that stores the average of the two grades
math$avg = (math$grade1 + math$grade2) / 2



```
